This project is just to show, my knowledge about coding in React Native. If you think i should delete it because of copyright just DM me. It shows an easy app to store places where you eat, and how tasty it was. The app is using mobile features such as, gallery, location and local storage. I want to place this on play store but I have some problems after the release. Due to lack of time I place it only here for my portfolio purposes. If you want to use the app you should paste the real API key stored in the util files in the setLocation.js file.

If you have expo installed on your machine the installation is very easy.
